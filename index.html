                <p>Hello! My name is Mueyliam Surigao and I'm currently a student. I have no experience with designing or coding websites. Therefore, I am currently attending Coding Bootcamp to further my skillset to explore a new career in web developement.</p>
                <p> My current career is far from web developement or coding. I've been working for a retail company for a little over 16 years. I've been so comfortable with what I'm currently doing, that this scares me.</p>
                <p>In my spare time, I like go fishing and love to travel. This year I was able to check one place off my bucketlist of travel. I finally made time to travel to Thailand and Laos! Traveling to those two countries was eye opening because I was born in Thailand at a refugee camp and came to the United States at a very young age. It was a very humbling experience. </p>
