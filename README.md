# Responsive-Portfolio

Created a basic portfolio with different pages

linked all three pages together with href 

Learn how to link image tags into page 

Included labels and text area or contact page

Was able to see how padding and margin change the difference of the content. 

Reloaded and added @media

Used background color to see the changes to the different max-width and then removed for final product
change text-aligned to nav and name bar to overwrite the codes above so when changed the max width it will change with.
